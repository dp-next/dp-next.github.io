Science, while generating cutting-edge knowledge, lags behind most
industry settings when it comes to practical, operational aspects. For
instance, while much of research done now relies heavily on software and
computational work, funding agencies rarely fund software and data
engineering projects, nor do many research groups hire these highly
skilled technical personnel. So, the aim of Work Package 1 is to
establish these skills and needs as a core component of this project and
to help do "better research in less time".

Our basic strategies will be to establish working groups, including a
group dedicated to "research operations" to fulfil this core aim, as
well as developing and implementing common practices and tools that
maximise collaboration and that follow some guiding principles. All
groups will include a "tech lead" who has technical knowledge and skills
and who will also be part of the research operations group, to help
coordinate WP groups with these practices. We aim to onboard and train
the tech leads in these practices by embedding them in some work done at
SDCA, where these practices have been developing and refining over the
last several years. The most relevant practices and skills that this WP1
aims to provide are in software and data engineering, iterative project
management, collaborative workflows and tools,

Pertinent to these practices is understanding and assessing risk and
challenges. The two biggest challenges we face with this WP1 are:

1.  The need for highly technical personnel who have sufficient
    fundamental expertise to understand and apply these practices, which
    we hope to minimise through the training and onboarding of the tech
    leads.
2.  the IT systems across centers that often donâ€™t work well together,
    which we hope to reduce the impact of by having a dedicated research
    operations group.

While this WP1 forms the foundation to all other WPs and in many ways
aims to support their success, the activities of WP1 are an increasingly
needed aspect of research globally. In this regard, we aim to produce
tangible and usable deliverables that are independent and valuable on
their own.

## Applications

The below content was used for the first and second rounds of applications.

### First round

-   **Characters**: 644

WP1 answers the increasing need for openness, transparency, and
reproducibility in research, will deliver the day-to-day project and
operations management of all the WPs and will facilitate close
collaboration and joint expertise development across all Steno Centres.

Effective coordination and management of complex projects such as
DP-Next requires modern and innovative approaches to project and
operational management. We will employ tools developed and tested at
SDCA in the past years [@Johnston2022; @DARTER; @ukbaid; @seedcase;
@sdca-github] to offer a practical framework for sharing knowledge and
technical skills across centres, aiming to deliver "better research done
in less time" [@Lowndes2017].

### Second round

-   **Characters**: 2200 / 1800 characters

Science, while pursuing cutting edge knowledge, lags behind industry in
standard operational, organisational, and technological practices,
tools, and methods. From this, the core visions of WP1 are to do better
research in less time [@Lowndes2017] and expand the capacity of modern
technical engineering-based skills in research groups across Steno and
Denmark. By applying modern operational, engineering, and project
management practices, we will optimize work done across the WPs. Through
formal and informal upskilling sessions, we will develop data
engineering and modern collaborative skills and knowledge in researchers
from across the Steno Centers.

At SDCA, we have been developing and applying these practices in
multiple projects [@Johnston2022; @DARTER; @ukbaid; @seedcase;
@sdca-github], which highlight tangible examples of WP1's activities.
The general strategy for WP1 is to: 1) develop and agree on some basic
principles for collaboration between centers and WPs that adhere to open
scientific practices and modern collaborative methods; 2) investigate
potential barriers to effective cross-Steno collaboration; 3) decide on
a set of common tools and standards to use across centers for WP.
Specific actions and tasks are found in @fig-gantt-wp1 and @fig-actions.

Aside from the traditional management group overseeing the project, we
will also have a research operations group that will simplify,
streamline, and automate the collaboration and coordination of
activities and products between WPs and centers as well as provide a
space for learning these technical skills. See @fig-organization and the
collaboration section below for more details, as well as @fig-gantt for
the general project timeline.

A major component of WP1 is also upskilling activities, in collaboration
with the NNF-funded software and training-based Seedcase Project
[@seedcase]. Training will focus on skills not often taught to
researchers, such as data engineering, modern collaborative practices,
and iterative project management methods.

potential challenges, and strategy.
