## First round

-   **Characters**: 644

WP1 answers the increasing need for openness, transparency, and
reproducibility in research, will deliver the day-to-day project and
operations management of all the WPs and will facilitate close
collaboration and joint expertise development across all Steno Centres.

Effective coordination and management of complex projects such as
DP-Next requires modern and innovative approaches to project and
operational management. We will employ tools developed and tested at
SDCA in the past years [@Johnston2022; @DARTER; @ukbaid; @seedcase;
@sdca-github] to offer a practical framework for sharing knowledge and
technical skills across centres, aiming to deliver "better research done
in less time" [@Lowndes2017].

## Second round

-   **Characters**: 654 / 1800 characters

Science, while pursuing cutting edge knowledge, lags far behind in general operational, organisational, and technological aspects that are standard practice in many industry settings.
From this, the core visions of WP1 are to do better research in less time [@Lowndes2017] and expand the
capacity of modern technical engineering-based skills in research
groups. By applying modern operational and project management practices,
we will optimize work done across the WPs. Through formal and informal
upskilling sessions, we will develop data engineering and modern
collaborative skills and knowledge in researchers from across the Steno
Centers. 

Strategy

At SDCA, we have been developing and applying these practices 


Management and groups

Aside from the traditional management group overseeing the
project, we will also have a operations group that will simplify
coordination between WPs and groups as well as provide a space for
learning these new technical skills.

Science is state of the art in knowledge, but lags far behind in general operational, organisational, and technological aspects. For instance, there are nearly no research software engineers within research groups or institutions, nor are basic modern communication and project management tools often used even though they are standard practice in many corporate settings. In particular, these aspects are not shared and advertised, so if they exist, others can reuse and learn about something that isnâ€™t shared. At SDCA, we are working to remedy that gap in knowledge and skill through several initiatives (LIST THEM).
